# Per-agent runtime selection through agents: entries in .fullsend/config.yaml
# (#6581, ADR 0091). The repo-wide `runtime:` is flipped to a real runtime for
# this scenario and the agents the scenario can dispatch are pinned back to
# dummy on their own agents: entries, so a passing run proves the per-agent
# entry beat the repo-wide key without any inference: the runner records which config entry
# decided in metrics.json (`runtime_source` ends with `agents.triage`).
#
# `code` is pinned too because triage hands off with `ready-to-code`, which
# dispatches the code stage on the same repo; without its own entry that run
# would start on the repo-wide runtime for real.
Feature: Per-agent runtime and model on agents: entries in config.yaml

  Scenario: an agents: entry selects the runtime for one agent over the repo-wide key
    Given a test repository with fullsend installed
    And the repository runtime is "claude"
    And the repository agents are configured with:
      """
      triage:
        runtime: dummy
      code:
        runtime: dummy
      """
    And a dummy agent that would:
      | description      | op            | args                                                      |
      | Emit triage JSON | write_fixture | output/agent-result.json, fixtures/triage/sufficient.json |
    And an issue
    When the issue is labeled "ready-for-triage"
    Then the triage workflow completes successfully
    And the run selected the "dummy" runtime from "agents.triage"
    And the agent will succeed to Emit triage JSON
    And the issue has label "ready-to-code"

  # Real-runtime half: the repo stays on the install default (dummy) and a
  # single custom agent is put on pi with its own model through
  # agents: entries. The harness itself says `model: opus`; the entry says
  # `haiku`, so a passing run proves both the runtime and the model of one
  # agent came from config.yaml, not from the harness or the repo-wide key.
  # Gated like pi.feature: one small haiku run on Vertex per suite run.
