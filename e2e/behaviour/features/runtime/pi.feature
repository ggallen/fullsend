# Runtime-specific coverage for pi (#6464). The rest of the suite runs every
# stage under the dummy runtime, which proves dispatch, harness loading and
# the sandbox boundary but never exercises a real runtime's Bootstrap/Run,
# the sandbox hook adapter, the Vertex credential path, or the stream
# parser. This scenario does, on the same leased per-repo install, by
# selecting pi for one run of a minimal agent whose tool use is deliberate
# (the custom-harness step only commits a placeholder agent, which would
# give a real model no task).
#
# Gated on the `runtime-pi` capability: the harness pins
# fullsend-sandbox:latest, which only carries the pinned pi CLI once the
# image change is published from main. Enable with
# BEHAVIOUR_CAPABILITIES=runtime-pi (costs one small haiku run on Vertex).
