# GPT on the pi runtime through OpenAI Workload Identity Federation (#6689,
# ADR 0092). The pi scenario proves the runtime on Vertex; this one proves
# the secretless OpenAI credential path end to end: the runner exchanges
# the job's OIDC token, a run-scoped OpenShell provider carries it, and pi
# reaches api.openai.com with nothing but the gateway's placeholder. A
# failed exchange or a rejected placeholder fails the workflow, so a
# successful run is the assertion.
#
# Gated on the `runtime-pi-openai` capability, which is NOT declared by
# default: it needs an OpenAI organization with a Workload Identity
# Provider and a service-account mapping for the pool repositories, plus
# the three FULLSEND_OPENAI_* repository variables on them (see
# docs/guides/infrastructure/openai-workload-identity.md). Enable with
# BEHAVIOUR_CAPABILITIES=runtime-pi,runtime-pi-openai (costs one small
# gpt-5.6-luna run).
Feature: pi runtime runs an agent on OpenAI without a credential in the sandbox
