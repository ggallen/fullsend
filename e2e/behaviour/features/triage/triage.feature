# Behaviour tests request triage via the ready-for-triage label (issues event).
# The per-repo shim ignores /fs-triage issue_comment events from bot users; CI
# uses minted e2e installation tokens, so label dispatch is the supported path.
Feature: Manual triage via ready-for-triage label

  Scenario: Triage applies ready-to-code and sandbox blocks disallowed URL
    Given a test repository with fullsend installed
    And a dummy agent that would:
      | description      | op            | args                                                      |
      | Search for foo   | url_get       | https://www.google.com/search?q=foo                       |
      | Emit triage JSON | write_fixture | output/agent-result.json, fixtures/triage/sufficient.json |
    And an issue
    When the issue is labeled "ready-for-triage"
    Then the triage workflow completes successfully
    And the run selected the "dummy" runtime
    And the agent will fail to Search for foo
    And the agent will succeed to Emit triage JSON
    And the issue has label "ready-to-code"
