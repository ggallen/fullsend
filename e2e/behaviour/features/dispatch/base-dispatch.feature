Feature: Base-composed harness dispatch

  Background:
    Given a test repository with fullsend installed
    And a harness-hosting repository "base-harness-host"

  Scenario: Base-composed harnesses dispatch with local and remote base variants
    # Local base harness (shared config, no trigger — not dispatched itself)
    Given a custom harness "local-base" with:

      | Prove base execution | write_fixture | output/dispatch-base-ok.json, fixtures/dispatch/ok.json |
    And an issue
    When the issue is labeled "ready-for-base-test"
    Then the harness "local-child" workflow completes successfully
    And the agent will succeed to Prove base execution
    And the harness "remote-base-child" workflow completes successfully
    And the harness "remote-child" workflow completes successfully
