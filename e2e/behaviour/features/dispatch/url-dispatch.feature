Feature: URL-sourced harness dispatch

  Scenario: URL source not in allowlist fails config validation
    # Production ValidateAgentEntries hard-fails the entire config when any
    # URL agent is outside allowed_remote_resources. No agents dispatch —
    # including the valid local harness — because config validation fails
    # before agent resolution begins.
