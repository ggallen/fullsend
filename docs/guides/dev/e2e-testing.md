Historical ADRs [0010](../../ADRs/0010-stored-session-for-e2e-browser-auth.md) (browser session) and
[0039](../../ADRs/0039-totp-automation-for-e2e-2fa.md) (2FA) are superseded for CI by cross-org mint
auth ([#2155](https://github.com/fullsend-ai/fullsend/issues/2155)); local runs no longer use
Playwright or stored sessions.

## Prerequisites

Before running e2e locally or in CI:

1. **Pool orgs** (`halfsend-01` … `halfsend-12`) provisioned per [Pool org provisioning](#pool-org-provisioning) below
2. **Mint** deployed with `e2e` role enrolled and `ALLOWED_ORGS` including `fullsend-ai`
3. **CI only:** pool orgs with `FULLSEND_FOREIGN_E2E_REPOS` authorizing `fullsend-ai/fullsend`
4. **Local only:** `gh auth login` (or `GH_TOKEN` / `GITHUB_TOKEN`) with admin access on pool orgs

## Local runs

1. Authenticate as an admin on the pool orgs (`gh auth login --web`, or export `GH_TOKEN`).
2. Run tests (uses `gh auth token`, `GH_TOKEN`, or `GITHUB_TOKEN`):

```bash
make e2e-test
```

Optional environment variables:

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `GH_TOKEN` / `GITHUB_TOKEN` | Override token source for local runs |
| `FULLSEND_MINT_URL` | Override mint endpoint (default: hosted public mint, same as `fullsend admin --mint-url`) |
| `E2E_LOCK_TIMEOUT` | Max wait for a free pool org (default 10m) |
| `E2E_GCP_PROJECT_ID` | GCP project for inference setup (`github setup --inference-project`) |

Behaviour tests use a dedicated `fullsend-ai-test` org with ephemeral `bt-{uuid}-{slot}` repos and install via `repos install --fullsend-ref`. See [behaviour-testing.md](behaviour-testing.md) and [behaviour-drivers.md](behaviour-drivers.md).

Tests acquire an exclusive lock on one org from the pool (`halfsend-01` …
`halfsend-12`) — see [ADR 0040](../../ADRs/0040-org-pool-for-parallel-e2e-tests.md).

Shared pool, CLI, and cleanup helpers used by both admin e2e and behaviour tests live in `pkg/e2etest/`. Admin-specific test logic remains in `e2e/admin/`.

## CI runs

In GitHub Actions, tests mint a cross-org installation token via the mint service:

1. Workflow requests a GHA OIDC token (`id-token: write`)
2. `mintclient.MintToken` POSTs to `{FULLSEND_MINT_URL or hosted default}/v1/token` with `{role: "e2e", target_org: "<pool org>", repos: ["*"]}` (`repos: ["*"]` is required for installation-wide cross-org access)
3. Mint verifies the caller against `FULLSEND_FOREIGN_E2E_REPOS` on the target org ([ADR 0060](../../ADRs/0060-cross-org-mint-authorization-via-org-variables.md))

Required repository secrets:

| Secret | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `E2E_GCP_WIF_PROVIDER` | GCP WIF provider (inference / auxiliary GCP access) |
| `E2E_GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` | GCP service account for WIF |
| `E2E_GCP_PROJECT_ID` | GCP project ID for inference secrets (`github setup --inference-project`) |
| `TEST_CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` | Cloudflare account ID for CF mint behaviour-test deploys (mapped to env `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` in the behaviour job) |
| `TEST_CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` | Test-only Cloudflare API token for Wrangler against Worker `mint-test` (mapped to env `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`; distinct from site-deploy `CLOUDFLARE_*`) |
| `TEST_ACTOR_WRITE_PAT` | Classic PAT for the write-level human-like test actor (`fstest-write`); exposed to the behaviour job under the same env name |
| `TEST_ACTOR_TRIAGE_PAT` | Classic PAT for the triage-level human-like test actor (`fstest-triage`); exposed to the behaviour job under the same env name |
| `TEST_ACTOR_OUTSIDER_PAT` | Classic PAT for the outsider (no org write) human-like test actor (`fstest-outsider`); exposed to the behaviour job under the same env name |

Mint URL uses the hosted public endpoint by default (same as `fullsend admin --mint-url`). Override with org/repo variable `FULLSEND_MINT_URL` if needed; no separate e2e secret.

### Behaviour job GitHub Environments

The behaviour job in `e2e.yml` binds to GitHub Environments `dev` (authorized pull requests and the merge queue) and `stage` (push to `main`). It skips `workflow_dispatch` and other triggers. The job sets `ENVIRONMENT` to the same value for the suite (`dev` or `stage`). GitHub auto-creates those environments on first use.

After the environments exist, restrict `stage` to `main`:

1. Open the repository **Settings → Environments → `stage`**.
2. Under **Deployment branches and tags**, choose **Selected branches and tags**.
3. Add a branch rule for `main`.

### Cloudflare Worker mint BT credentials

The behaviour job wires `TEST_CLOUDFLARE_*` into Wrangler’s standard `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` / `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` env names so CF mint BT (#5109) can upload versions of Worker **`mint-test`**. These secrets must **not** reuse the production site-deploy `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` / `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` used by `site-deploy.yml` (Worker `site`).

Prefer **`wrangler versions upload --name=mint-test --preview-alias=…`** so runs use preview URLs (`<alias>-mint-test.<subdomain>.workers.dev`) rather than inventing new Worker names or relying on the production `mint-test.…workers.dev` route (which may stay disabled). Cloudflare Account API tokens cannot currently attach Workers Scripts permissions under a Specified-Workers-only policy; operators use a dedicated Workers Edit token (for example `fullsend-ai/fullsend-mint-test`) that is separate from site-deploy credentials and intended only for this test path.

### Behaviour tests and per-repo mint enrollment

Behaviour tests install fullsend in **per-repo** mode using `repos install --fullsend-ref` (or `github setup --vendor` as fallback). They run in the dedicated `fullsend-ai-test` org with ephemeral `bt-{uuid}-{slot}` repos that are created on demand and deleted after each scenario. Triage workflows on ephemeral repos mint same-org `triage` tokens from reusable workflows; that requires per-repo mint enrollment (`PER_REPO_WIF_REPOS`). The install driver does **not** run `mint enroll` — per-repo enrollment for ephemeral repo names must be pre-provisioned by a GCP admin on the hosted mint project.

Admin e2e uses the singular `halfsend-NN/test-repo` name. Behaviour tests use the `fullsend-ai-test` org with unique `bt-{uuid}-{slot}` repo names via the unified `install.Driver`; these repos are **lazily created and installed** on demand (see [behaviour-testing.md](behaviour-testing.md#repo-allocation-via-unified-driver)). Concurrent CI runs never collide because each run generates a unique UUID prefix. Enroll base names only — do **not** enroll `*-fork` names (forks are ephemeral PR sources and mint against the enrolled base repo). GitHub repositories need not exist yet — enroll is a mint allowlist / WIF-provider update only.

Inference (`E2E_GCP_PROJECT_ID`) and mint (`it-gcp-konflux-dev-fullsend` for the hosted mint) may be different GCP projects. The behaviour install driver runs `fullsend inference provision <org>/<repo>` using CI credentials on the inference project (same access model as admin e2e), then passes the repo-scoped WIF provider to install. `E2E_GCP_WIF_PROVIDER` authenticates the CI job itself; it is not written to test-org repo secrets.

The CI service account needs inference-provision IAM on `E2E_GCP_PROJECT_ID`:

| IAM role | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `roles/iam.workloadIdentityPoolAdmin` | Create/update repo-scoped inference WIF providers |
| `roles/resourcemanager.projectIamAdmin` | Grant `roles/aiplatform.user` to repo WIF principals |

One-time enrollment for admin e2e pool orgs (idempotent):

```bash
export GCP_PROJECT=it-gcp-konflux-dev-fullsend
for i in $(seq -w 1 12); do
  go run ./cmd/fullsend mint enroll "halfsend-${i}/test-repo" \
    --project="$GCP_PROJECT" --region=us-central1
done
```

Re-run enrollment when adding a new pool org or after mint infrastructure changes that drop `PER_REPO_WIF_REPOS` entries. See [mint-administration.md](../infrastructure/mint-administration.md) for required operator IAM.

## Pool org provisioning

Each pool org must be provisioned before e2e can use it:

1. Org exists with `botsend` as owner
2. `test-repo` and `e2e-lock` repos (lock created at runtime)
3. Test actor permissions granted (see [Test actor permissions](#test-actor-permissions) below)
4. All role apps installed, including `fullsend-ai-e2e` with **Repository → Variables: Read and write** (`actions_variables`) and **Organization → Variables: Read and write** (`organization_actions_variables`)
5. `FULLSEND_FOREIGN_E2E_REPOS` includes `fullsend-ai/fullsend` with org-wide visibility (`visibility: all`)
6. Mint enrolled: org in `ALLOWED_ORGS`, `${ORG}/e2e` in `ROLE_APP_IDS`, e2e app PEM enrolled

Use the idempotent setup script:

```bash
MINT_PROJECT=... MINT_FUNCTION=... hack/setup-new-e2e-org.sh 07
```

Verify foreign authorization:

```bash
go run ./cmd/fullsend admin foreign list --org halfsend-01
# expect e2e → fullsend-ai/fullsend
```

Existing pool orgs (`halfsend-01` … `halfsend-12`) need a one-time operator pass: install the e2e app (if missing) and run:

```bash
go run ./cmd/fullsend admin foreign allow --org halfsend-NN --role e2e --caller fullsend-ai/fullsend
```

For repo-level grants (scoped to a specific target repo rather than the
entire org), add `--repo`:

```bash
go run ./cmd/fullsend admin foreign allow --org halfsend-NN --role e2e --caller fullsend-ai/fullsend --repo target-repo
go run ./cmd/fullsend admin foreign list --org halfsend-NN --repo target-repo
```

See [ADR 0083](../../ADRs/0083-repo-level-foreign-allow-list.md) for details
on repo-level foreign grants.

### Test actor permissions

Pool orgs grant three test actor accounts specific access levels for
e2e testing of permission-sensitive behaviour:

| Actor | Org membership | Repo permission on base `test-repo*` |
|-------|----------------|--------------------------------------|
| `fstest-write` | member | push (write) |
| `fstest-triage` | member | triage |
| `fstest-outsider` | none | public read only (no collaborator grant) |

Elevated access uses direct collaborator grants (not team membership). Fork repos
(`test-repo-fork`) are intentionally excluded — they are not base/enrolled
targets for permission grants.

The setup script (`hack/setup-new-e2e-org.sh`) creates or verifies this
model idempotently. To auto-accept org membership invitations, pass the
actor PATs as environment variables:

```bash
TEST_ACTOR_WRITE_PAT=ghp_... TEST_ACTOR_TRIAGE_PAT=ghp_... \
  MINT_PROJECT=... MINT_FUNCTION=... hack/setup-new-e2e-org.sh 07
```

Without the PAT variables, the script pauses for manual acceptance.

Accounts and PATs are managed under
[#6024](https://github.com/fullsend-ai/fullsend/issues/6024). PATs are
stored as repository secrets `TEST_ACTOR_WRITE_PAT`,
`TEST_ACTOR_TRIAGE_PAT`, and `TEST_ACTOR_OUTSIDER_PAT` on
`fullsend-ai/fullsend`.

## CI authorization

Pull requests trigger e2e via `pull_request_target` in
[`.github/workflows/e2e.yml`](../../../.github/workflows/e2e.yml) so fork PRs can
use repository secrets. Because that exposes credentials to untrusted code, a
**gate job** runs first (see workflow comments for why it is a separate job).

### Who runs automatically

E2E tests run without maintainer action when the PR author is an org/repo
**member** or **collaborator** (`author_association` of `OWNER`, `MEMBER`, or
`COLLABORATOR` on the base repo). The gate uses the frozen
`github.event.pull_request.author_association` from the workflow event — not a
live REST lookup — because `GITHUB_TOKEN` lacks `read:org` and cannot see org
membership for members with private visibility. (Note: agent dispatch paths use
the collaborator permission API instead, which does not have this limitation —
see [ADR 0054](../../ADRs/0054-require-authorization-on-all-agent-dispatch-paths.md).)

### Who needs `ok-to-test`

External contributors and fork PR authors must have a maintainer apply the
**`ok-to-test`** label **after** the latest push. The label must be created once
in GitHub repo settings (Settings → Labels).

### Stale labels

If new commits are pushed after `ok-to-test` was applied, the label is removed
automatically and e2e is skipped until a maintainer re-applies it after
reviewing the latest changes. Freshness compares the label timestamp against
the frozen PR `updated_at` from the workflow event (`PR_UPDATED_AT`); the live
API fallback may over-reject when non-push activity bumped `updated_at`.
Applying the label triggers the **E2E ok-to-test** / **Functional ok-to-test**
caller workflows, which `workflow_call` into the main suites.

The main **E2E Tests** and **Functional Tests** workflows do **not** subscribe to
`labeled` events. Only `opened` / `synchronize` / `reopened` cancel in-progress
work in the per-PR concurrency group (code changed). Label events are
authorization only: they **never** cancel an in-progress suite. If a suite is
already running when `ok-to-test` is applied, GitHub may queue a second run
behind it (no expression-only “skip if busy”); that is accepted.

Other labels (for example `ready-for-review`, `requires-manual-review`, or
`component/*`) do **not** authorize e2e. They may start the thin ok-to-test
caller with a skipped `run` job (GitHub cannot filter by label name at `on:`),
but they do not start skipped checks under the **E2E Tests** / **Functional
Tests** workflow names, and they never enter the suite concurrency group.

### Blocked runs

When the gate **runs** and denies authorization, a sticky PR comment (marker
`<!-- e2e-gate -->`) explains why and what to do. That is distinct from a
non-`ok-to-test` label event, where the thin caller skips without invoking the
gate. Re-run the workflow or add/re-apply `ok-to-test` as appropriate.

## CI architecture

1. **PR open/sync** — **E2E Tests** / **Functional Tests** run gate then suite
   jobs (trusted authors authorized immediately)
2. **`ok-to-test` label** — thin **E2E ok-to-test** / **Functional ok-to-test**
   workflows call the same suites via `workflow_call` (fork / external path)
3. **Gate** — authorize the PR author or a fresh `ok-to-test` label (base
   checkout only; never checks out PR head)
4. **E2E** — checkout PR head SHA, authenticate to GCP via WIF, mint cross-org
   tokens per pool org, `make e2e-test`

Pushes to `main`, merge queue, and `workflow_dispatch` skip the gate and run e2e
directly.

## Test GitHub Apps

The `fullsend-test-*` apps are **test-only** GitHub Apps owned by `fullsend-ai`,
separate from the production `fullsend-ai-*` app set. They exist for temporary
and test mints, including the Cloudflare Worker mint BT chain. There is **no
`e2e` test app**. The `fix` role shares the coder test app and PEM (same as
production).

> **Warning:** Do **not** enroll these apps on the production community mint.
> They are strictly for test infrastructure.

### Role / app / secret inventory

| Role | App Slug | App ID | Repository Secret |
|------|----------|--------|-------------------|
| fullsend | `fullsend-test-fullsend` | `4312984` | `TEST_FULLSEND_PEM` |
| triage | `fullsend-test-triage` | `4312988` | `TEST_TRIAGE_PEM` |
| coder | `fullsend-test-coder` | `4312994` | `TEST_CODER_PEM` |
| review | `fullsend-test-review` | `4313005` | `TEST_REVIEW_PEM` |
| retro | `fullsend-test-retro` | `4313010` | `TEST_RETRO_PEM` |
| prioritize | `fullsend-test-prioritize` | `4313012` | `TEST_PRIORITIZE_PEM` |

PEM private keys are stored as repository secrets on `fullsend-ai/fullsend`.
The `fix` role reuses the coder app (`fullsend-test-coder`) and
`TEST_CODER_PEM`.

### Installation targets

All six apps are installed with access to **all repositories** on
`halfsend-01` through `halfsend-12`.

### App permission scopes

Each app is registered with the minimum explicit permissions its corresponding
role requires. Tokens minted for these apps are downscoped by the mint to the
canonical role permissions (see `internal/mintcore/github.go`).

`metadata:read` is implicitly granted to all GitHub App installations and is
not listed below. The canonical role permissions in `internal/mintcore/github.go`
include it for token downscoping completeness, but it is not an explicit
registration setting.

| Role | Permissions |
|------|-------------|
| fullsend | `actions:write`, `actions_variables:read`, `administration:write`, `checks:read`, `contents:write`, `issues:read`, `members:read`, `organization_projects:read`, `pull_requests:write`, `workflows:write` |
| triage | `contents:read`, `issues:write` |
| coder | `checks:read`, `contents:write`, `issues:write`, `pull_requests:write` |
| review | `checks:read`, `contents:read`, `issues:write`, `pull_requests:write` |
| retro | `actions:read`, `contents:read`, `issues:write`, `pull_requests:write` |
| prioritize | `contents:read`, `issues:write`, `organization_projects:write` |

### Operator notes

**PEM rotation:** Generate a new private key on the app's settings page
(`https://github.com/apps/<slug>/settings`), then update the corresponding
`TEST_*_PEM` repository secret on `fullsend-ai/fullsend`. If the app is
enrolled on a test mint, update the PEM secret there as well.

**Cloudflare test token rotation:** Create a new Account API token with Workers
Edit (or the Edit Cloudflare Workers template), store it as
`TEST_CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`, and keep `TEST_CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` aligned with
the account that hosts Worker `mint-test`. Do not put the new value into
site-deploy `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`.

**Installing on a new pool org:** Install each app via its public install
URL:

```bash
# For each app slug in the inventory table above:
# https://github.com/apps/<slug>/installations/new
# Select the target pool org and grant access to "All repositories".
```

**Using App IDs in `ROLE_APP_IDS` for temporary mints:** When configuring a
temporary or test mint (e.g., the CF Worker mint), set `ROLE_APP_IDS` using
the App IDs from the inventory table:

```json
{
  "fullsend": "4312984",
  "triage": "4312988",
  "coder": "4312994",
  "review": "4313005",
  "retro": "4313010",
  "prioritize": "4313012"
}
```

Point the mint's PEM directory (or Secret Manager entries) at the
corresponding `TEST_*_PEM` keys.
